Overview
This Python script analyzes air quality index (AQI) data to provide insights into air pollution levels from different countries of the world. It processes raw AQI data, computes key statistics, and generates visualizations to help understand air quality trends.

Features
Data Processing: Reads and cleans AQI data from various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).
Statistical Analysis: Computes average, median, and other statistical measures of air quality.
Visualization: Generates charts and graphs to visualize air quality trends over time.
Reporting: Outputs summary reports and analysis results in a user-friendly format.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
seaborn (optional): For enhanced visualizations.
scikit-learn (optional): For any additional machine learning analysis.
You can install the required packages using pip:

Prepare Your Data:

Ensure your AQI data is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
The data should include at least the following columns: date, location, AQI value
Run the Script:

--input: Path to the input AQI data file.
--output: Path where the analysis report will be saved.
Review the Output:

The script will generate a report with key statistics and visualizations saved in the specified output directory.
Configuration
You can customize the script by modifying the configuration variables at the top of the script:

INPUT_FILE_PATH: Default path for the input AQI data file.
OUTPUT_DIR: Default directory for saving analysis reports and visualizations.
PLOT_STYLE: Style options for visualizations (e.g., 'seaborn-darkgrid').

Troubleshooting
File Not Found: Ensure the input file path is correct and the file exists.
Missing Columns: Check that the data file contains the necessary columns (date, location, AQI).
